### Background
PIMCO is an established player in this industry but specifically in the fixed income securities side. PIMCO’s general mission, objectives, values is to deliver superior investment returns by using a research-driven investment approach and offering innovative solutions across various client needs. This project is relevant to both PIMCO and the general industry in that it enhances data accessibility and operational efficiency by allowing non-technical users to retrieve critical financial information quickly, aligning with the industry’s trend toward automation, AI integration, and data democratization. This project also supports PIMCO’s commitment to innovation, helping streamline decision-making and improve client service through faster, more accurate data insights.
**The challenge, simply put, is to create an LLM chatbot that can transform natural language into SQL queries, verify that these queries run and provide estimates of the accuracy of the process.**

### Project Goals
- Develop a user-friendly interface where users can input questions in natural language and receive accurate SQL queries and corresponding results
- Increase accessibility to structured data by allowing users without SQL knowledge to extract information efficiently
- Ensure that the output is not only accurate but also credible, providing sufficient supporting data points and justifications
